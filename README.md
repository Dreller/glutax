# Welcome to GluTax code repository
Online tool to track Gluten-free expenses for easy tax reporting.  In Canada, Canada Revenue Avency does allow a tax deduction for the extra amount you pay for a Gluten-free product.  Unfortunately, managing a spreadsheet can be complicated and the calculation for the *extra* amount is not simple.
